## LocationScreen
 Swift code for an iOS app that includes a `SearchResults` class with a `MKLocalSearchCompleter` delegate, a `RecentLocationsSheet` and `MapView` struct, and a `LocationScreen` struct that displays a map with search bars for the user's current location and destination, as well as a button to display a list of recent locations. The `MapView` struct uses `MKMapView` to display the map, and the `SearchResults` class is used to fetch and display search completions for the destination search bar. The `RecentLocationsSheet` struct displays a list of recent locations in a sheet when its corresponding button is tapped. The `LocationScreen` struct coordinates all of these components and serves as the main user interface for the app.
